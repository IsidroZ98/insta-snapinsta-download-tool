## ðŸ“˜ Project Context

âœ… **This was a learning/experimental project.**  
This codebase was originally written as a hands-on exploration of Selenium WebDriver automation using Java. It was part of a personal learning journey and should be seen as a starting point, not a production-ready solution.

âœ… **The tool it interacts with is no longer active.**  
The automation script was built around the website `https://snapinsta.app/`, which may no longer function as expected due to site changes or deprecation. As a result, the current code may not work until updates are made.

âœ… **The project may be updated or revived in the future.**  
While the code is currently not maintained, it is being shared publicly to demonstrate experience and may serve as the foundation for a revived or related automation tool in the future.

âœ… **The revival goal of this project would use a prompt** 
From the prompt it will ask the user to enter a link and use 1 or 2 online clients to enter the url and wait for a success message and a downloaded file in the user's Download folder.
